START OF MY STUDY IN PYTHON


Hello everyone, my name is Odiljon Toirjonov, 
I'm in the 9th grade, I'm currently 15 years old, I live in Uzbekistan,
this is my repository for my studies, which lasted 9 months, during this period I studied: python, PostgreSQL, JANGO, and much more, 
I will leave this repository open, if someone wants to learn python on their own, then maybe it will come in handy for him
